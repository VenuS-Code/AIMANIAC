# Machine Learning Basics: A Beginner's Guide

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. In this guide, we'll explore the core concepts of machine learning and how it's revolutionizing various industries.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data. For example, if you want to classify emails as spam or not spam, you would train the model with examples of both types.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, finding patterns and relationships without prior knowledge. This is useful for tasks like customer segmentation or anomaly detection.

### Reinforcement Learning
This type involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.

## Common Applications

1. Image Recognition
2. Natural Language Processing
3. Recommendation Systems
4. Fraud Detection
5. Autonomous Vehicles
